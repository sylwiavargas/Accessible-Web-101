    <h1>Designing for Inclusion</h1>
    <div class="intro">
        <p> Contrary to a common belief, accessibility does not refer only to permanent conditions, limitations, impairments or disability. Sometimes exclusion is temporary - even a short-term injury or context affects the way people interact with the world around them, if only for a short time. Think about looking into a bright light, wearing a cast, or ordering dinner in a foreign country. </p>

        <p>Sometimes exclusion is situational. As people move through different environments, their abilities can also change dramatically. In a loud crowd, they can’t hear well. In a car, they’re visually impaired. New parents spend much of their day doing tasks one-handed. An overwhelming day can cause sensory overload. What’s possible, safe, and appropriate is constantly changing.</p>
        <p>In fact, many of the solutions designed as <a href="https://www.atia.org/at-resources/what-is-at/">assistive technology</a> were later adapted by the general public. Did you know that electric toothbrushes were initially designed for people with weak arm muscles? </p>
        <p>How amazing would it be if we designed everyday objects, web apps, buildings or entertainment for all users! </p>
