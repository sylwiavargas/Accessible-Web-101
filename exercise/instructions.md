# Make this page accessible!

## Before you begin:
1. Open exercise.html in your browser
2. Read exercise.html code
3. Skim through ex-stylesheet.css
4. Make this app accessible!

## Here's what you may wanna check:
1. Use keyboard navigation (tab to move down and shift+tab to go up):
- is the flow coherent and logical? 
- is the flow how you'd expect it?
- is the focus clearly recognizable and easy to follow?
2. Can you spot the link easily? 
3. Do pictures have alt attribute?
4. Did you check the contrast in contrast checker?
5. Are you using semantic HTML?
6. Is the font accessible?
7. Did you check what happens if we change the size of the window? 
8. Did you include lang tag in your html?
9. Why can't we see the box contents?
10. Are the variables named right?

## Hints (each point refers to respective task):
1. in order to enable keyboard navigation, check tabindex value in html and focus in css;
2. if you want to target a tag, use just the tag name; if it's a class, then remember to insert dot beforehand;
3. Decorative pictures should have empty alt tag;
